        My research integrates fieldwork, natural history collections, genomics,
        and the development of digital tools to address speciation,
        biogeography, and conservation questions. In particular, it centers on
        identifying patterns of small mammal diversity and understanding
        speciation processes within and across islands in the Indo-Australian
        Archipelago. I have also engaged in projects focusing on other taxa and
        in different regions. Most of the tools I develop are taxon-agnostic. My
        collaborative work involves more than a dozen people in some projects. I
        strive to make research using natural history collections and genomic
        data accessible to students and researchers with limited technical
        knowledge and access to computing resources.

      <Content>
        The Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) is a complex island system. The
        Sunda Shelf islands (e.g., Sumatra, Java, Borneo) were connected during
        the Pleistocene, while the Sahul Shelf islands experienced similar
        connections. Sulawesi formed from separate islands, and others like the
        Moluccas and Lesser Sunda islands were never connected to nearby
        landmasses. Isolated mountains within these islands promote other
        opportunities for speciation. This project focuses on studying small
        mammal diversity and speciation, particularly in Sulawesi and the Sunda
        Shelf, involving extensive fieldwork, genomic studies, and describing
        undocumented species as necessary. For my dissertation, I focus on
        in-situ diversification of hill rats (<i>Bunomys</i>) on Sulawesi,
        aiming to improve phylogenetic resolution and understand how the
        island's geological history has shaped their diversity. I hope to aid
        conservation efforts and deepen our understanding of speciation on a
        large, isolated island like Sulawesi.

      <Content>
        Every aspect of collection-based evolutionary studies has become
        increasingly complicated. Museum scientists have now routinely collected
        voucher specimens with numerous parts and complex derivative data
        features. Studies using natural history collections often involve
        intricate and computationally demanding genomic data analyses. To reduce
        the technical difficulties of these workflows, enhance computing
        efficiency, and improve data integration, I develop open and accessible
        software, targeting part of the workflow where investment in quality
        software is lacking or not yet present. I aim to facilitate inclusive
        and mutually beneficial international collaborations through innovative
        data management, data-sharing approaches, and low-cost computing
        practices. To achieve my goals, I leverage emerging technologies in
        software development (e.g., <Link
          text="Rust"
          url="https://www.rust-lang.org/"
        />, <Link text="Flutter" url="https://flutter.dev/" />, and <Link
          text="CI/CD"
          url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD"
        />
        ) to create user-friendly, memory-efficient, and cross-platform software.
        Whenever feasible, I support mobile operating systems, offering a more flexible
        way to collect data in the field and allowing teaching genomic analyses where
        access to computing power is limited. I also capitalize on advancements in
        CPU technology and <Link

          url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing"
        /> to accelerate data processing and reduce reliance on power-hungry and
        costly High-Performance Computing Clusters. Promoting more energy- and resource-efficient
        data analysis practices reduces the ecological footprint of evolutionary
        studies while allowing underfunded labs to benefit from the decreasing cost
        of genomic sequencing.
