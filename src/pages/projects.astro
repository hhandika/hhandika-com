          <h2>Small Mammal Diversity & Evolution</h2>
          <h3>
            Understanding patterns that generate species diversity within a
            complex island system
          </h3>
          <p>
            Indo-Australian Archipelago is among the most complex island system
            on earth. Some islands, such as Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, were
            continuous landmass during the Pleistocene low see level, called
            Sunda Shelf. Sulawesi was separate islands. Other islands never been
            connected to other landmasses, such as the Moluccas and Lesser Sunda
            islands. Within the islands, isolated mountains present more
            opportunities for speciation. We work on deciphering small mammal
            diversity and evolution in this complex island system, with
            particular focus on Sulawesi and the Sunda Shelf.

          <h3>
            In situ diversification of Hill Rats (<i>Bunomys</i>) on Sulawesi
          </h3>
          <p>
            The hill-rat species group, also referred as the
            <i>Bunomys</i> Clade, is the most diverse endemic rodent group on Sulawesi.
            From a single known colonizing ancestor, the group has diversified into
            18+ species. Some species occur throughout the island. The other species
            are restricted to a single area of endemism or only known from a single
            mountain. This project is the main focus of my PhD. We hope to understand
            how complex geological history of Sulawesi shaped the diversity of the
            group. Our understanding of this process will help us to understand the
            evolution of small mammals in complex island systems. It will also provide
            an improved understanding of species distribution to inform conservation
            efforts on Sulawesi.
