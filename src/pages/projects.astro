        My research integrates fieldwork, museum collections, and the
        development of digital tools to address speciation, biogeography, and
        conservation questions. In particular, it centers on identifying
        patterns of small mammal diversity and understanding speciation
        processes within and across islands in the Indo-Australian Archipelago.
        I have also engaged in projects focusing on other taxa and regions,
        aiming to help advance biodiversity research. I strive to make
        biodiversity research, especially involving museum collections and
        genomic data, accessible to students and researchers with limited
        technical knowledge and access to computing resources.

      <Content>
        The Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) is a complex island system. The
        Sunda Shelf islands (e.g., Sumatra, Java, Borneo) were connected during
        the Pleistocene, while the Sahul Shelf islands experienced similar
        connections. Sulawesi formed from separate islands, and others like the
        Moluccas and Lesser Sunda islands were never connected to nearby
        landmasses. Isolated mountains within these islands promote other
        opportunities for speciation. This project focuses on studying small
        mammal diversity and speciation, particularly in Sulawesi and the Sunda
        Shelf, involving extensive fieldwork, genomic studies, and describing
        undocumented species as necessary. For my dissertation, I focus on in
        situ diversification of hill rats (<i>Bunomys</i>) on Sulawesi, aiming
        to improve phylogenetic resolution and understand how the island's
        geological history has shaped their diversity. This research will aid
        conservation efforts and deepen our understanding of speciation on a
        large, isolated island like Sulawesi.

        Field-based evolutionary studies have become increasingly complex,
        including everything from data collection in the field to downstream
        data analysis. It is now standard practice for museum scientists to
        collect voucher specimens with numerous accompanying parts and complex
        associated data features. On the downstream side, studying biodiversity
        using genomic sequencing, ranging from thousands of loci to entire
        genomes, has become the new standard. I am developing open and
        accessible software to simplify these complex workflows, improve data
        integration and research reproducibility, and promote inclusive and
        mutually beneficial international collaborations. I adopt emerging
        technologies in software development to create user-friendly,
        memory-efficient, and mobile-friendly software whenever possible. I also
        take advantage of improvements in CPU technology and heterogenous
        computing to accelerate data processing while promoting energy and
        resource-efficient computing practices.
